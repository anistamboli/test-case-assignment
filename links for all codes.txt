#Assignment codes in Python

This are the codes and their respective test cases for assignment questions in python language.

For book management system using dict instead of test cases I have provided code run snippets for crrate, add, remove, search and show all operations...

For all other remaining codes there is one main code file taking user input as well as other test file providing test code with conditions...

direct links for all codes are given below:
